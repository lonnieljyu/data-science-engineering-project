1. What were some of the design decisions you made to improve the efficiency of at least one of the commands you implemented? Was there a particular algorithm or data structure that you decided to use?

2. Suppose you had to use this tool on a huge csv file that was too big to fit in memory, how would you have to change your implementation, if at all, to handle this?

3. If our dataset was very wide (a lot of columns) and we didn't care about the exact distance between points, we only wanted to find one row in the data set that is close to a given query point or a list of query points, how could you do this efficiently in terms of memory/computation? 

4. Is there anything you would like to share or point out from your solution? An awesome pythonic code snippet used? A cool feature/option/argument/command you added? A rant about why python is terrible/amazing? 

5. Do you have a github account you can share or a code sample of another project you are proud of?

6. What's your favorite open source project?
